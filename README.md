In this example you can see a ready to use template for create Entry Points.

We have included two examples:

* An Entry Point that creates and Opportunity using a similar WebToLead url. Also we create or update an Account and a Contact depending is these records already exists.
* An Entry Point that draws a Google Chart (Donut) showing all Opportunities related to a specific account.
